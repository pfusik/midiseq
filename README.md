Patched MIDI Sequencer
======================

MIDI Sequencer is a music editor for 
[Atari 8-bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family)
with the [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) interface
written in 1993 by Maciej Sygit.

Here I patched the binary adding:
* instant replay of the notes entered while composing
* opening the SEQ files by specifying them in the SpartaDOS command line
